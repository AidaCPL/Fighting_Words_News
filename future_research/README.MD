# CONCLUSION

The research aimed to uncover the various use of words in environmental news coverage across diverse news outlets in the United States and to infer their biases. Through the application of innovative Fighting Words method, the research explored how different news stations frame and communicate environmental issues to their audiences. The results effectively address the research question by revealing distinct linguistic patterns and tendencies within environmental news coverage across CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC. Furthermore, this research contributes to the field by extending the application of the Fighting Words method to the analysis of environmental news discourse. The findings highlight the importance of linguistic analysis in uncovering implicit biases and editorial perspectives encoded in news coverage. 

However, our analysis faces several limitations. Utilizing snippets instead of full transcripts might introduce biases and restrict the comprehensiveness of our findings. Moreover, the dataset's exclusive focus on environmental topics and reliance solely on TV news transcripts may fail to capture the entirety of news coverage from each outlet, potentially neglecting crucial themes or narratives present in other forms of communication such as Twitter posts or articles. Thus, future research could expand upon our findings by incorporating larger and more diverse datasets, including full transcripts and multimedia content. Additionally, exploring the impact of contextual factors such as audience demographics and geographic location on news coverage could provide further insights into media framing of environmental issues. Furthermore, time studies tracking changes in news coverage over time could elucidate evolving perspectives and public discourse on environmental topics.
