**Abstract:** This study utilizes NLP techniques to examine linguistic variations in how environmental topics are presented across diverse U.S. news outlets. Drawing from a dataset of video news segment excerpts spanning 2009 to 2020, the research seeks to identify biases. Through the application of the Fighting Words analysis method, distinct editorial priorities and framing strategies emerge. These findings underscore the significance of linguistic analysis in comprehending media depictions of environmental issues, advancing computational social science research. The study finds that CNN tends to frame of environmental challenges as urgent and significant crises, and covering controversies, MSNBC emphasize political dynamics, legislation, and specific politicians, Fox News suggest a focus on global warming and on assigning blame on environmental topics.

## Introduction

This research project scrutinizes how news media communicate information on environmental topics. Leveraging NLP techniques and text-as-data analysis, the study focuses on identifying distinctive words and features used by various news stations in the US. Understanding how news outlets frame and discuss environmental issues is crucial for shaping public perception and attitudes towards conservation efforts. Moreover, as news media significantly influence public opinion and policy agendas, it becomes relevant to understand their communication strategies.

The existing literature regarding the method this research applies, is relatively sparse. The seminal work by Monroe et al, "Fightin’ Words: Lexical Feature Selection and Evaluation for Identifying the Content of Political Conflict" (2008), introduces a methodological framework that significantly departs from traditional approaches like tf-idf, addressing their limitations and proposing innovative solutions. Despite the significance of this contribution, there remains a notable gap in research exploring alternative applications beyond the political domain. While the methods proposed by Monroe et al. offer valuable insights, their adaptation and extension to other contexts, such as environmental news coverage, remain largely unexplored.

With limited existing research, this project aims to innovate by adapting Monroe et al.'s (2008) methodology to analyze environmental news discourse. By recognizing traditional method limitations in capturing nuanced linguistic patterns, the research seeks to address this gap. As the goal is inference, the research question is: How do linguistic variations in environmental news coverage across diverse U.S. news outlets inform their perspectives or biases?
