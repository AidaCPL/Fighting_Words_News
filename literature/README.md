Namely, it includes the an exploration of a paper previously published that is related with the research in question. Additionally, it includes how the previous literature relates to the research idea presented in this repository.

## Introduction of the paper
The selected paper, is titled "Fightin’ Words: Lexical Feature Selection and Evaluation for Identifying the Content of Political Conflict", written by Burt L. Monroe, Michael P. Colaresi, Kevin M. Quinn in 2008. 

## Background and Motivation:
In the realm of political science, the advent of the 'text-as-data' movement has led to a proliferation of studies analyzing political discourse using computational techniques. These studies often involve identifying and analyzing lexical features (words or phrases) that differentiate between various political groups or actors. Such analyses are crucial for understanding political dynamics, including issue framing, representation, and polarization. However, existing methods for lexical feature selection and evaluation suffer from several limitations, including inefficiency, overfitting, and lack of semantic validity.

## Application Scenarios and Broader Views:
The importance of research in lexical feature selection and evaluation lies in its application to understand and analyze political conflict, particularly in representative democratic systems. By accurately capturing the substance of political discourse, these techniques facilitate the examination of relationships among citizens, elected representatives, and political parties. Moreover, they enable the exploration of issues such as issue framing, representation, and polarization, which are fundamental to political analysis.

## Unsolved Issues or Problems in the Literature:
The literature on lexical feature selection and evaluation faces several challenges. Existing methods often fail to adequately account for sampling variation and may produce word lists with low semantic validity or high sensitivity to arbitrary decisions. Overfitting of idiosyncratic differences between political groups is also a significant concern. These limitations hinder the accurate identification and weighting of words that capture the essence of political conflict.

## Research Questions:
The primary research questions addressed in this paper are twofold: 
1. How can lexical features that differentiate between political groups be effectively identified and selected?
2. How can the relative importance of these features be accurately evaluated?

## Methodology:
The methodology employed in this research involves:
- **Data Source and Datasets:** The analysis is conducted using textual data from political speeches, likely sourced from public archives or databases.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Bayesian shrinkage and regularization techniques are introduced and emphasized as novel approaches to address the limitations of existing methods.
- **Software and Computing Platforms:** The research likely utilizes specialized software for text analysis and statistical computing platforms for implementing machine learning algorithms.

## Potential Results:
Based on the methods used, potential findings of the research include:
1. Improved methods for identifying and weighting lexical features that differentiate between political groups.
2. Reduced emphasis on frequently used or infrequently used words across all groups.
3. Enhanced semantic validity and stability of word lists across different political contexts.

## Potential Implications and Limitations:
The potential implications of the findings include:
- Advancement in the accuracy and reliability of political text analysis.
- Facilitation of more nuanced and comprehensive studies on issue framing, representation, and polarization.
- Limitations may include the need for further refinement and validation of the proposed methods, as well as potential challenges in generalizing the findings across different political contexts.

## Intellectual Merits and Impacts:
This research advances existing literature by:
- Offering novel approaches to address longstanding challenges in lexical feature selection and evaluation.
- Providing insights into the theoretical and conceptual uniqueness of language production in politics.
- Inspiring future research directions aimed at unlocking the full potential of political text analysis.


### Connection between Current Literature and Project Idea

The existing literature regarding the method this research applies, is relatively sparse. The seminal work by Monroe et al, "Fightin’ Words: Lexical Feature Selection and Evaluation for Identifying the Content of Political Conflict" (2008), introduces a methodological framework that significantly departs from traditional approaches like tf-idf, addressing their limitations and proposing innovative solutions. Despite the significance of this contribution, there remains a notable gap in research exploring alternative applications beyond the political domain. While the methods proposed by Monroe et al. offer valuable insights, their adaptation and extension to other contexts, such as environmental news coverage, remain largely unexplored.
